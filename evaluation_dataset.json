      "question": "What is the recommended first-line therapy for lipid lowering in patients with chronic coronary disease (CCD), and what is the target LDL-C reduction?",
      "ground_truth": "Statins remain first-line therapy for lipid lowering in patients with CCD. The aim with high-intensity statin therapy is to achieve a ≥50% reduction in LDL-C levels to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). For patients in whom high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated, moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels.",
